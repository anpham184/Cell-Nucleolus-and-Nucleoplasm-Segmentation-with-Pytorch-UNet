Cell-Nucleolus-and-Nucleoplasm-Segmentation-with-Pytorch-UNet

A multipleclasses segmentation pipeline using Pytorch-UNet for 2D maximum intensity projection images of Nucleolus and Nucleoplasm in HeLa cells. Images contain information of NPM1 proteins tagged with mRuby3, which demixed into a dense phase (the nucleolus) and a dilute phase (nucleoplasm). Train-Masks were generated from original dataset using Ilastik segmentation.
